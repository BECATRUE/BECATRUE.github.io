	<dt>(Suspension) Sequencer GUI Upgrade &nbsp; (2022.01 ~ 2022.01)</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>It was planned to complete a new Sequencer GUI before the spring semester to suit the increasingly complex system. Research on ARTIQ came first, so it was stopped.</p>

	<dt>ARTIQ analysis &nbsp; (2022.01 ~ expected 2022.02)</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The purpose is to take a rough look at ARTIQ and understand how the experiment is constructed and executed. Furthermore, I looked at how it could be applied and developed in my lab's system.</p>
